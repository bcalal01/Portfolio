A collection of personal and academic projects I've made as a computer science and art student:
  -BusinessmanSimulator: mobile website game where the player controls a tamogatchi-esque businessman | HTML, JavaScript, CSS
  -HOHLS: 4-minute animation made of ASCII art | C++
  -PixelDraw: website for creating pixel drawings | HTML, JavaScript, CSS
